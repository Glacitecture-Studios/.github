# Glacitecture Studios

**Glacitecture Studios** is a small, recently-formed team of independent game and software developers. We specialize in building immersive gameplay experiences and powerful development tools, mostly in C# (we do dabble in GDScript though), and always with love and a touch of chaos.

## :memo: Our Projects

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only open-source or source-available works of ours are listed here. Any closed-source or commercial works can be found in our Discord, which is linked at the bottom of this README file.

### üéµ Syncra Engine
**The Powerful Open Source Global Rhythm Game Level Editing Toolkit (POSGRGLET for short. We dare you to pronounce it) made for power users and rhythm enthusiasts alike.**  
A feature-rich level editing framework for rhythm games with support for:
- Multi-difficulty charting
- Custom event scripting
- Timeline waveform editing
- Real-time collaboration
- Format export utilities

Built for developers, mappers, and tinkerers who demand precision and flexibility.

**‚úÖ This project is open-source! You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/WinterBlox/syncra-engine)**

## :ice_cube: About Us

We're Glacitecture Studios: explorers, programmers, and storytellers. Whether we're crafting high-precision toolkits or sculpting immersive worlds, we aim to make cool things that people care about.

We love:
- Open-source software
- Deep game mechanics
- Community collaboration

And we hate:
- Feature creep (but we do it anyway üòÖ)

## ‚ùó Project Status & Transparency

We believe in clarity, *especially* when it comes to open and closed development. Thus:
- All projects here will have their source availability explicitly declared.
- Closed-Source or Commercial Projects will not be listed here. Those can be found in our Discord, which is linked at the bottom.

## ü§µ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Interested in Joining Us?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that we make these games & tools for free and we do not have the funds to pay our developers (we started as a group of friends so that wasn't in our plan initially), therefore please treat this as volunteering.

We're currently **not accepting new developers**, but here‚Äôs what the process *will* look like once we are ready:

### How it will work:

1. **Watch this space**\
  Keep an eye on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GfMPPDrEVb). That‚Äôll be where we announce openings or collaboration opportunities.

2. **What to prepare**\
   A short **demo reel** or **portfolio** showcasing your past game/engine work as well as how we can contact you

3. **Initial Steps**\
   We'll reach out to you once the application period is over if you were considered, and invite you to a casual chat so we can get to know each other. 

4. **Welcome Aboard!**\
   If all goes well, then you'll be on the team! 
## üí¨ Stay Connected

We‚Äôre still setting up shop, but feel free to:
- Watch our repos to follow development
- Fork, contribute, or file issues
- Say hi through our Discussions or social links (coming soon)
- Reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/GfMPPDrEVb) if you want to talk licensing or collaborations (or if you just want to keep up with our closed-source works!)

Thanks for stopping by! ‚ùÑÔ∏è
