# Glacitecture Studios

**Glacitecture Studios** is a small, recently-formed team of independent game and software developers. We specialize in building immersive gameplay experiences and powerful development tools, mostly in C# (we do dabble in GDScript though), and always with love and a touch of chaos.

## :memo: Our Projects

### üéµ Syncra Engine
**The Powerful Open Source Global Rhythm Game Level Editing Toolkit (POSGRGLET for short. We dare you to pronounce it) made for power users and rhythm enthusiasts alike.**  
A feature-rich level editing framework for rhythm games with support for:
- Multi-difficulty charting
- Custom event scripting
- Timeline waveform editing
- Real-time collaboration
- Format export utilities

Built for developers, mappers, and tinkerers who demand precision and flexibility.

**‚úÖ This project is open-source! You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/WinterBlox/syncra-engine)**

### üåê rEboot
**A 2D four-key downscroll rhythm game set inside the digital world of a computer.**  
Brandish the waveform against your adversaries, experience what was once a thriving civilization, now brought to ashes by corruption, and unlock secrets buried deep within.
Fast-paced action. A deep story. And a whole lot of binary funk.

**üö´ This project is closed-source due to it being planned to have online features.**

---

### üåå Desolation
**A 2D exploration-focused RPG set in a vast, alien galaxy that‚Äôs just as hostile as it is beautiful.**  
Wander worlds teeming with the unknown, where every pixel hides a secret and every shadow hungers for you.  
Designed for those who like their adventures atmospheric, surreal, and a little bit haunting.

**üö´ This project is closed-source due to it being planned to have online features.**

### :anchor: Drifted Souls *(Coming Soon)*
**A 3D gritty roguelike adventure RPG set across an archipelago of danger and decay.**  
Battle through cursed waters, uncover long-forgotten classes, and defy abominations crawling up from the realms below.

Coming soon to your nightmares.

**‚ùî This project will be source-available when we begin development.**

## :ice_cube: About Us

We're Glacitecture Studios: explorers, programmers, and storytellers. Whether we're crafting high-precision toolkits or sculpting immersive worlds, we aim to make cool things that people care about.

We love:
- Open-source software
- Deep game mechanics
- Community collaboration

And we hate:
- Feature creep (but we do it anyway üòÖ)

## ‚ùó Project Status & Transparency

We believe in clarity, *especially* when it comes to open and closed development. Thus:
- All projects here will have their source availability explicitly declared.
- Any commercial or closed-source projects will not have their store/download pages linked here. (you will have to search them yourself, sorry!)

## ü§µ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Interested in Joining Us?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that we make these games & tools for free and we do not have the funds to pay our developers (we started as a group of friends so that wasn't in our plan initially), therefore please treat this as volunteering.

We're currently **not accepting new developers**, but here‚Äôs what the process *will* look like once we are ready:

### How it will work:

1. **Watch this space**\
  Keep an eye on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GfMPPDrEVb). That‚Äôll be where we announce openings or collaboration opportunities.

2. **What to prepare**\
   A short **demo reel** or **portfolio** showcasing your past game/engine work as well as how we can contact you

3. **Initial Steps**\
   We'll reach out to you once the application period is over if you were considered, and invite you to a casual chat so we can get to know each other. 

4. **Welcome Aboard!**\
   If all goes well, then you'll be on the team! 
## üí¨ Stay Connected

We‚Äôre still setting up shop, but feel free to:
- Watch our repos to follow development
- Fork, contribute, or file issues
- Say hi through our Discussions or social links (coming soon)
- Reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/GfMPPDrEVb) if you want to talk licensing or collaborations (or if you just want to keep up with our closed-source works!)

Thanks for stopping by! ‚ùÑÔ∏è
